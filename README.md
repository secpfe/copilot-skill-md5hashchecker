# Overview
This GitHub repo hosts a Flask web app that acts as a wrapper for nitrxgen.net for MD5 hashes checks (checking if the provided hash is known/exposed, or not known).
It's designed for easy integration with Microsoft Copilot for Security as an OpenAPI compliant API.

## Example plugin
KnownMD5CfS.yaml within this repository serves as a sample plugin description for Copilot for Security. 
It illustrates how to leverage this API for a custom CfS skill focused on MD5 hash verification.
